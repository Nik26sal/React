--Hydration--> Injecting the JavaScript in Rendering Tree or Dom Tree called as Hydration.

--Page Reloading(Hot Reloading)--> It means that Browser Remove or Destroy here Tree and repaint a new Dom tree.

--By the Method present in React named as 'createRoot' the virtual Dom is Create by the JavaScript and the work of Reconcilition is done.

--By the help of this Virtual Dom  and the Reconciliation the Reloading process become more Faster and Efficient.

--Reconciliation--> Comparing own DOM Structure and the Browser Dom structure called as Reconciliation.

                            or 

                    diff one tree to Another

--For Updating then Virtual Dom the algorithm that used called as Fibre.

-- The Concept of Fibre is Come in chapter because the react imediately mke    updation on any changing request. This mainly affect the animations,layout
   and Gestures

-- Fibre has a feature of Pause,abort and reuse of work as a new updation comes in.It has Also have ability to assign priority to differnt type of updates.It also improve the process of Hydration.

-- In present time fibre is well implemented algorithms.

--Update --> A change in the data used to render a React app.

The key points of fiber algorithm are:

--1.Different component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree completely.

--2.Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."

The key points are:

--1.In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately; in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.
--2.Different types of updates have different priorities â€” an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, say, an update from a data store.
--3.A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. 
    A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.

--We've established that a primary goal of Fiber is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling. Specifically, we need to be able to

--1.pause work and come back to it later.
--2.assign priority to different types of work.
--3.reuse previously completed work.
--4.abort work if it's no longer needed.
